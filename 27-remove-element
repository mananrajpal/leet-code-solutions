        Since the problem requires us to solve the question in a space complexity of O(1), we cant use two arrays.
        To solve this problem we will use the pointer method specifically two pointers. One pointer stays at the index for the value to be set and 
        increments once the previous value has been set, the other pointer iterates over the length of entire array find each suitable value and 
        once the suitable value is found, it is set to the index which left_pointer is at and the left_pointer is incremented to the next index.
